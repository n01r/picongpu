     * \brief Thomas-Fermi pressure ionization
     *
     * This ionization model describes the atom inside the Thomas-Fermi framework
     * in a self-consistent way. There the electrons are modeled as a density
     * with respect to the distance from the core while the atomic core is often
     * assumed as a point charge. The atomic potential is considered to be finite
     * as a result of matter density and it defines the so-called "ion sphere".
     * Due to the overlap of adjacent ion spheres the ionization barrier can be
     * lowered and electrons become quasi-free in the system (resonance states).
     * The Thomas-Fermi model calculates an average ionization degree only with
     * respect to charge density and temperature. Through further assumptions
     * and fitting parameters the model gets extended to arbitrary temperatures
     * and atoms.
     *
     * See table IV from Pressure Ionization, Resonances, and the Continuity of
     * Bound and Free States
