    /** Ionization potentials
     *
     * Please follow these rules for defining ionization energies of atomic species,
     * unless your chosen ionization model requires a different unit system than AU:
     *     - input of values in either atomic units or converting eV or Joule to them
     *     -> use either UNITCONV_eV_to_AU or SI::ATOMIC_UNIT_ENERGY for that purpose
     *     - use float_X as the preferred data type
     *
     * example:
     *     ionization energy for ground state hydrogen: 13.6 eV
     *     1 Joule       = 1 kg * m^2 / s^2
     *     1 eV          = 1.602e-19 J
     *
     *     1 AU (energy) = 27.2 eV
     *                   = 1 Hartree
     *                   = 4.36e-18 J
     *                   = 2 Rydberg
     *                   = 2 x Hydrogen ground state binding energy
     *
     * Atomic units are useful for ionization models because they simplify the
     * formulae greatly and provide intuitively understandable relations to a
     * well-known system, i.e. the Hydrogen atom.
     *
